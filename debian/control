Description: promiscuous mode traffic accountant
 pmacct is a tool designed to gather traffic information (bytes and number
 of packets) by listening on a promiscuous interface or for Netflow data,
 which may facilitate billing, bandwidth management, traffic analysis, or
 creating usage graphs.
 .
 Data can be stored in memory and queried, displayed directly, or written
 to a database; storage methods are quite flexible and may aggregate totals
 or keep them separate.
